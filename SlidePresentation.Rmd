## The Project Overwiew

To build text-prediction model application with R Shiny package that predicts words using a Natural Language Processing is the goal of this Project. 

The task is trying to predict "the next most common" word based on given a word or phrase as user's input. It is similar to the platform using in almost of smart phone keyboards today.

The key tasks:
(1.) Create all R datassets and files needed for TheNextWordPrediction Model
(2.) Build the Shiny App and host it at shinyapp.io
(3.) Make summary slides for presentation purpose which is hosted at R pubs

## TheNextWordPrediction Model

The principles of **tidy data** applied to text mining in R. The key steps involved the word prediction model as follow:

* Input data set: creat training datasets from raw text files
* Clean the raw data: clean all non-characters, symbols, and badwords; then separate into 2, 3 and up-to 7 word n-grams and save as tibbles
* The n-grams tibbles were sorted by frequency and saved them as *.rds* files
* Functions used to predict word is a **back-off** type
      - Users enter an input word/phrase
      - Model uses the last 6-1 word(s) to predict the best match of the next word in the training dataset.
* Output: the most common next word is predicted

## The Predictor Shiny App

**Overview:** A simple user interface in APP to stimulate the next word prediction model. 

The below image describes how the app functions and its instructions.
